# Push_swap


**Push_swap** is a project from 42 that challenges you to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to sort the numbers using the fewest possible moves while following strict constraints on how the data can be manipulated.

---

## Objectives

- Parse and validate a list of integers
- Use two stacks (`a` and `b`) and a limited set of operations
- Implement an efficient sorting algorithm tailored to the constraints
- Optimize the number of operations used

---

## Allowed Operations

- `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the first 2 elements at the top of a stack
- `pa`, `pb`: Push the top element from one stack to the other
- `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate a stack up by 1 (first element becomes last)
- `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Reverse rotate a stack (last element becomes first)

---

## Technologies

- C programming language  
- Makefile for compilation
